# local-storage-event-delegation

Practice persisting state with local storage, and with event delegation (process of using event propagation (bubbling) to handle events at a higher level in the DOM than the element on which the event originated).

Project created as part of [JavaScript 30](https://javascript30.com/), a 30-day vanilla JS coding challenge.
